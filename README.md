# Infinite Zoom Loop

An infinite zoom loop effect implementation using React, Three.js, and TSL (Three.js Shading Language).

This project follows [Yuri Artuikh's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDo7RTzizoOdPjY8A-xDR7g) on creating infinite zoom effects. While the original tutorial uses vanilla Three.js and TSL, this implementation adapts the concepts for use with React.

## Tech Stack

- React + Vite
- Three.js
- TSL (Three.js Shading Language)
- TypeScript

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
